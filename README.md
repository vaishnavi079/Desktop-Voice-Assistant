# Desktop-Voice-Assistant
Nowadays, it isn’t surprising to hear someone speak to someone that isn’t there. We ask
Alexa for the weather and to turn the temperature down on the thermostat. Then, we ask Siri
what our schedule for the day is and to call people. We are connected now more than ever
using our voice and voice interface technology. I can’t imagine doing things manually
anymore!

A voice assistant is a software agent that can perform tasks or services for an individual based on verbal commands i.e. by interpreting human speech and respond via synthesized voices. Users can ask their assistants’ questions, media playback via voice, and manage other basic tasks such as send an email, open to-do lists, open or close any application etc. with verbal commands.
